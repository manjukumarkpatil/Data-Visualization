Assignment 4:

	•	Create data.csv file.
I have used the given data and used R script to create the CSV file which is saved in data.csv file.

	•	Plotting the vector field.
Using the px, py for each of the x, y values, I calculated the gradient for each value. The magnitude and orientation have been found. The data has been plotted in which the line length represents the magnitude (green line) and the direction of this line represents the orientation (black dot for pointing the direction). 

Skipped every 20 elements on each row, and subsequently skipped 20 rows for each column in plotting. i.e, made it 20*20 resolution.


Interesting points:
	The plot describes the vector visualization.  We can see the direction of flow from the graph. If you plot all the 400*400 points, the visualization is not smooth and its not pleasing to see. Hence sampling makes it visually appealing. I have attached the screenshot of vector.png which shows the plot for this sampling data. I have also attached the vector.html file which is the D3 code for the same.

	•	Plotted Jitter vector field.
Plotted for jitter field also using random sampling. Jitter.png is the screenshot and jitter.html has the code which ran it.



Note: I had the permission to submit late.
